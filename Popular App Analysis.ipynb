This can help developers to understand what types of apps they should build to generate profits. Given that we only develop free apps, so the main source of revenue is in-app ads. The revenue of an app will largely depending on how many customers it has. Our goal of this project is to identify what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users."

    "However, this niche seems to show some potential. One thing we could do is take another popular book and turn it into an app where we could add different features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes about the book, etc. On top of that, we could also embed a dictionary within the app, so users don't need to exit our app to look up words in an external app.\n",

    "2. Food and drink — examples here include Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, etc. So making a popular food and drink app requires actual cooking and a delivery service, which is outside the scope of our company.\n",
